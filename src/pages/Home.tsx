              Call Before You Cut (CBYC) is a free program for all Minnesotaâ€™s family and individual
              woodland owners who want guidance and advice on determining if a woodland timber
              harvest is the right for them. With the support of the Minnesota DNR, the Minnesota
              Forestry Association provides up to a half-day walkthrough of your woods by a
              professional forester at no cost to you.
